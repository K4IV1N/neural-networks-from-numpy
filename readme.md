# Neural Networks From Scratch — NumPy only

This project demonstrates how **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** work **from first principles**, implemented **entirely using NumPy**.

No PyTorch.  
No TensorFlow.  
Only **math → intuition → code**, with a lightweight **PyTorch-inspired API** to help you understand both the underlying mechanics and modern deep-learning design.
