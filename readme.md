# Neural Networks From Scratch — NumPy only

This project demonstrates how to build **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** `entirely using NumPy`.

**No** PyTorch or TensorFlow.
The coding style is inspired by **PyTorch**.

## How to Read This Project

Each topic in this project is organized into two parts:

`Markdown Lecture (.md)` \
Provides a detailed explanation of the concept, including theory, diagrams, and step-by-step breakdowns.

`Corresponding Code (.ipynb)` located in the **code/ folder** \
Contains the implementation of the lecture topic, written entirely in NumPy and following a PyTorch-inspired coding style.
